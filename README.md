# Web-Scrapping

This is a personal project created to scrape article-relevant images from the news website. The code is written using Python and the data is scraped using BeautifulSoup.

The twist was - the content generated on the used website is dynamic making it difficult to scrape images directly through HTML. Solution? Using the embedded javascript content for the displayed article and then extracting images from it.
